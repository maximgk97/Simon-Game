# Simon-Game

A JavaScript implementation of the classic memory game Simon.
The device will play a pattern of blinking colors, your job is to match this pattern. 
The number of steps goes up by one after each level until it reaches 20, at which point the user wins the game.
Additionally, strict mode can be enabled, which upon a user mistake, drops the score to 0.
